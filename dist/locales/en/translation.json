They have been cultivated since the times of the pre-Colombian civilizations (XIII-XVI century), the <b>Aztecs and the Incas</b>, who considered them to be a gift from their Goddess Axomana. At the time, potatoes were the basic food ingredient for these populations of the highlands, where they grew spontaneously.<br/><br/>They were discovered by the Spaniard <b>Francisco Pizarro</b>, the ruthless conqueror of Peru, who imported them to Spain during the early Sixteenth century and gifted them to his King as a botanical curiosity."

According to the legend, the Queen’s cook, who was not familiar with the plant, used its leaves to prepare a salad instead of using its tuber. The Queen found the dish disgusting, and immediately summoned the explorer Walter Raleigh, who had offered the gift, back to court to explain how it was to be used.<br/><b>Germany:</b>Potatoes were already known in Germany as far back as the early XVII century.Only in 1756, when dealing with a terrible famine, did Frederick II issue the “kartoffelbefehl” edict, thus ordering it to be cultivated in every field in order to feed the population.<br/><b>France:</b>Potatoes were taken to France by the agronomist Parmentier, who had discovered their use during a period of imprisonment in Prussia. Queen Antoinette was responsible for spreading the use of the potato plant’s flowers to decorate wigs and in the court gardens. Only in 1785, Louis XVI, with the help of Parmentier, convinced the population to cultivate them for food purposes."

				"modal_content": "<b>Biological phases</b><br/>The biological cycle of the potato varies, in terms of its start, duration and end, according to the typology, country and region of the cultivation (between 3 and 5 months).<br/><b>Sowing:</b> After adequately preparing the field for sowing, the already sprouted potatoes, from the previous harvest, are placed 15 cm underground and distant from each other.<b>Sprouts:</b> After more or less 20 days, the buds will sprout. Vegetative development: during this phase, the sprouts also give birth to the stems which, later, form their own roots. These roots, also known as runners, have a bushy look underground, while on the surface they can reach a height between 30 and 90 cm, according to the variety of potato.<b>Flowering:</b> The flowers appear after more or less 40-60 days. Their color can be white or pinkish, according to the typology of potato.<b>Growth of the tubers:</b> This phase is called tuberization: the tubers form in the final part of each runner, and grow over the course of time.<b>Ripening:</b> The leaves turn yellow, the stems curve towards the ground and the surface of the tuber becomes more resistant due to the formation of an external layer, the skin of the potato. Harvest: When the leaves start drying out and the development of the tuber is complete, the harvest can begin. The peasants use spades and pitchforks to remove the potatoes from the ground, while paying maximum attention not to damage them. Finally, they leave the potatoes to dry and place them in wooden crates."

These potatoes are generally very consistent and compact, usually smaller than other potatoes and have a roundish shape.<br/>In cooking, they are used in many ways and are very tasty, ideal if cooked in the oven. If boiled, the skin loses much of its color and the pulp can become slightly darker.<br/><b>New potatoes:</b>are called this way because they are harvested before fully ripening. They are small, their skin is thin and their pulp is tender and compact.<br/>In cooking, they are excellent roasted or boiled. Their skin is so thin that it can be eaten along with the pulp."
